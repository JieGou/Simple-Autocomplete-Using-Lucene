# Simple-Autocomplete-Using-Lucene

This project consists in a system that indexes single words and their weights (frequency of use), providing very fast and ordered suggestions, according to their weight, based on prefix and similar words (much like the functionality of smartphones' suggestions when typing messages).

At first, it was developed in a private version control system, but it was decided afterwards to make it public. The details of implementation and some diagrams will be added shortly to this repository.
